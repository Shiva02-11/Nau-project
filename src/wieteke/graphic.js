                    As an AmeriCorps member, I developed a 224-page identification book for all native and the most common non-native and invasive plant species found on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, including botanical descriptions, photographs of plants in different phenological stages, and general information about species occurrence and abundance across the Refuge over time.
